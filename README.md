This web application generates graphs dynamically providing the edges of the graphs as inputs. The nodes and edges in the graph can be adjusted dynamically. Enter each graph edges in one line. Enter edges as pairs of nodes, separated by spaces. (e.g.: 1 2) After Graph is generated, you can drag the edges for better visualization. Source Code flow of control: The web application is developed based on the JavaScript using go.js library, it uses the demonstration of associative arrays. It uses two associative arrays. The first associative array links the numerical values to the nodes of the graph. The second associative array links the transitions in the graph with the edges we provided.
